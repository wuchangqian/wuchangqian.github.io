       sed - stream editor for filtering and transforming text</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS
       sed [OPTION]&hellip; {script-only-if-no-other-script} [input-file]&hellip;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION
       Sed  is  a stream editor.  A stream editor is used to perform basic text transformations on an input stream (a file
       or input from a pipeline).  While in some ways similar to an editor which permits scripted edits (such as ed),  sed
       works  by  making  only one pass over the input(s), and is consequently more efficient.  But it is sed&rsquo;s ability to
       filter text in a pipeline which particularly distinguishes it from other types of editors.</p>

<pre><code>   -n, --quiet, --silent

          suppress automatic printing of pattern space

   -e script, --expression=script

          add the script to the commands to be executed

   -f script-file, --file=script-file

          add the contents of script-file to the commands to be executed

   --follow-symlinks

          follow symlinks when processing in place

   -i[SUFFIX], --in-place[=SUFFIX]

          edit files in place (makes backup if SUFFIX supplied)

   -b, --binary

          open files in binary mode (CR+LFs are not processed specially)

   -l N, --line-length=N

          specify the desired line-wrap length for the `l' command

   --posix

          disable all GNU extensions.

   -r, --regexp-extended

          use extended regular expressions in the script.

   -s, --separate

          consider files as separate rather than as a single continuous long stream.

   -u, --unbuffered

          load minimal amounts of data from the input files and flush the output buffers more often

   -z, --null-data

          separate lines by NUL characters

   --help
          display this help and exit

   --version
          output version information and exit

   If no -e, --expression, -f, or --file option is given, then the first non-option  argument  is  taken  as  the  sed
   script  to  interpret.  All remaining arguments are names of input files; if no input files are specified, then the
   standard input is read.

<p>COMMAND SYNOPSIS
       This is just a brief synopsis of sed commands to serve as a reminder to those who already know sed; other  documen‐
       tation (such as the texinfo document) must be consulted for fuller descriptions.</p>

<p>   Zero-address &ldquo;commands&rdquo;
       : label
              Label for b and t commands.</p>

<pre><code>   #comment
          The comment extends until the next newline (or the end of a -e script fragment).

   }      The closing bracket of a { } block.
</code></pre>

<p>   Zero- or One- address commands
       =      Print the current line number.</p>

<pre><code>   a \

   text   Append text, which has each embedded newline preceded by a backslash.

   i \

   text   Insert text, which has each embedded newline preceded by a backslash.

   q [exit-code]
          Immediately quit the sed script without processing any more input, except that if auto-print is not disabled
          the current pattern space will be printed.  The exit code argument is a GNU extension.

   Q [exit-code]
          Immediately quit the sed script without processing any more input.  This is a GNU extension.

   r filename
          Append text read from filename.

   R filename
          Append a line read from filename.  Each invocation of the command reads a line from the file.  This is a GNU
          extension.
</code></pre>

<p>   Commands which accept address ranges
       {      Begin a block of commands (end with a }).</p>

<pre><code>   b label
          Branch to label; if label is omitted, branch to end of script.

   c \

   text   Replace the selected lines with text, which has each embedded newline preceded by a backslash.

   d      Delete pattern space.  Start next cycle.

   D      If  pattern  space contains no newline, start a normal new cycle as if the d command was issued.  Otherwise,
          delete text in the pattern space up to the first newline, and  restart  cycle  with  the  resultant  pattern
          space, without reading a new line of input.

   h H    Copy/append pattern space to hold space.

   g G    Copy/append hold space to pattern space.

   l      List out the current line in a ``visually unambiguous'' form.

   l width
          List  out  the  current line in a ``visually unambiguous'' form, breaking it at width characters.  This is a
          GNU extension.

   n N    Read/append the next line of input into the pattern space.

   p      Print the current pattern space.

   P      Print up to the first embedded newline of the current pattern space.

   s/regexp/replacement/
          Attempt to match regexp against the pattern  space.   If  successful,  replace  that  portion  matched  with
          replacement.   The  replacement  may contain the special character &amp; to refer to that portion of the pattern
          space which matched, and the special escapes \1 through \9 to  refer  to  the  corresponding  matching  sub-
          expressions in the regexp.

   t label
          If  a  s///  has done a successful substitution since the last input line was read and since the last t or T
          command, then branch to label; if label is omitted, branch to end of script.

   T label
          If no s/// has done a successful substitution since the last input line was read and since the last t  or  T
          command, then branch to label; if label is omitted, branch to end of script.  This is a GNU extension.

   w filename
          Write the current pattern space to filename.

   W filename
          Write the first line of the current pattern space to filename.  This is a GNU extension.

   x      Exchange the contents of the hold and pattern spaces.

   y/source/dest/
          Transliterate  the  characters in the pattern space which appear in source to the corresponding character in
          dest.
</code></pre>

<p>Addresses
       Sed commands can be given with no addresses, in which case the command will be executed for all input  lines;  with
       one  address, in which case the command will only be executed for input lines which match that address; or with two
       addresses, in which case the command will be executed for all input lines which match the inclusive range of  lines
       starting  from  the first address and continuing to the second address.  Three things to note about address ranges:
       the syntax is addr1,addr2 (i.e., the addresses are separated by a comma); the line which addr1 matched will  always
       be  accepted,  even  if  addr2 selects an earlier line; and if addr2 is a regexp, it will not be tested against the
       line that addr1 matched.</p>

<pre><code>   After the address (or address-range), and before the command, a !  may be inserted, which specifies that  the  com‐
   mand shall only be executed if the address (or address-range) does not match.

   The following address types are supported:

   number Match  only  the  specified line number (which increments cumulatively across files, unless the -s option is
          specified on the command line).

   first~step
          Match every step'th line starting with line first.  For example, ``sed -n 1~2p'' will print all the odd-num‐
          bered  lines in the input stream, and the address 2~5 will match every fifth line, starting with the second.
          first can be zero; in this case, sed operates as if it were equal to step.  (This is an extension.)

   $      Match the last line.

   /regexp/
          Match lines matching the regular expression regexp.

   \cregexpc
          Match lines matching the regular expression regexp.  The c may be any character.

   GNU sed also supports some special 2-address forms:

   0,addr2
          Start out in "matched first address" state, until addr2 is found.  This is similar to 1,addr2,  except  that
          if  addr2 matches the very first line of input the 0,addr2 form will be at the end of its range, whereas the
          1,addr2 form will still be at the beginning of its range.  This works only when addr2 is a  regular  expres‐
          sion.

   addr1,+N
          Will match addr1 and the N lines following addr1.

   addr1,~N
          Will  match addr1 and the lines following addr1 until the next line whose input line number is a multiple of
          N.
</code></pre>

<p>REGULAR EXPRESSIONS
       POSIX.2 BREs should be supported, but they aren&rsquo;t completely because of performance problems.  The \n sequence in a
       regular expression matches the newline character, and similarly for \a, \t, and other sequences.</p>
